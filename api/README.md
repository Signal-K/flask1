# FLASK REST API

Using Flask to create a REpresentational State Transfer API that can interface with different web services (eventually including it in our own).

Starting off with a Youtube "bot":
* [Youtube Developers Documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)

Then going on to services like Keybase/Matrix/Slack/Discord, Git, Jira, and then [stand-alone APIs built with Flask](https://realpython.com/flask-connexion-rest-api/) which will be a big backbone of our Arcadia "suite" of API plugins/bots.

Some cool ideas to add this into:
* Various games with APIs (or just to automate games)
* Web.Simple-MMO.com
* More to come

Using flask & web forms like search and contact.
